### Features
* Store and manage PDF documents in a single-user or compatible, multi-user (on-prem or cloud) database where theyâ€™re indexed to provide full-text search functionality.
* Upload PDF documents individually or in bulk. In addition, Upload Profile folders can be setup to allow for integration and automation.
* Apply a category/tax year to selected documents and when PDF documents are uploaded.
* Set the flag state on a selected document and when PDF documents are uploaded to mark for follow-up.
* Add notes to a selected document that can include the date, time, and user account name. All notes can be edited and are indexed by the database.
* Find documents by Search Term, Selections (Author/Subject/Category/Tax Year), or Date Added. In addition, flagged documents or all documents can be listed.
* With PDFKeeper, the following functions can be performed on a selected document: PDF viewing with the bundled or default viewer; PDF bursting; flag document state management; notes viewing and editing; keywords, PDF preview, PDF text, and search term snippets (when applicable) are also displayed for viewing.
* Export selected PDF documents with their category, tax year, notes, and flag state from the database for easy importing.

These features are available in version 8.0.0.
