### Features
* Store PDF documents in a compatible, relational database where theyâ€™re indexed and can be managed by any computer that has PDFKeeper installed on your network.
* Upload PDF documents individually or in bulk. In addition, configured folders can be setup to allow for integration and automation.
* Apply a category to selected document records and when PDF documents are uploaded.
* Set the flag state on a selected document record and when PDF documents are uploaded to mark for follow-up.
* Add notes to a selected document record that can include the date, time, and database user account name. All notes can be edited and are indexed by the database.
* Search for document records by Text, Selections (Author/Subject/Category), or Date Added. In addition, the user can list document records that are flagged or all document records in the database.
* With PDFKeeper, the following functions can be performed on a selected document record: PDF document viewing with the bundled or default viewer; flag document state management; notes viewing and editing; keywords, PDF preview image, and PDF text are also displayed for viewing.
* Export selected PDF documents with their category, notes, and flag state from the database for easy importing.
