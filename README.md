* PDF documents can be uploaded individually or in bulk, with or without using configured Upload folders.
* Document record functions include, PDF document viewing with the bundled or default viewer, Notes editing, Keywords viewing, PDF document Preview image viewing, and viewing of Text extracted from the PDF document.

Future releases will include support for additional relational database management systems based on user request and the feasibility of implementation. For a database to be considered, please open an new issue, unless one was already opened. If your database has already been requested, please update the existing issue.
