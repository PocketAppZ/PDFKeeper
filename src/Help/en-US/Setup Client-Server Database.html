Client-Server Database</font></h1>
<p><font face="Segoe UI, sans-serif">PDFKeeper can be setup to use a
compatible, client-server relational database for document storage.
It is recommended that the relational database management system be
installed on a dedicated computer system that is capable of handling
the expected load.</font></p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI, sans-serif">At this time, PDFKeeper has only
been designed for client-server use with <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/" target="_blank">Oracle
Database</a>. Future releases may include support for additional
relational database management systems based on user request and the
feasibility of implementation. For a database to be considered,
please open a new issue on the <a href="https://github.com/rffrasca/PDFKeeper/issues" target="_blank">Issue
Tracker</a>.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Segoe UI, sans-serif">As an
alternative to the fully supported, paid editions of Oracle Database,
Oracle offers an easy to install, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/xe.html" target="_blank">Oracle
Database Express Edition (XE)</a> which is perfect for small work
group environments that do not need a fully supported edition or for
those who just wish to try out PDFKeeper &ndash; all completely free!</font></p>
