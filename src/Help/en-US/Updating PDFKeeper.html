<P><FONT FACE="Segoe UI, sans-serif">PDFKeeper was redesigned to be a
service application that will check if an update is available during
application startup.  When an update is available, it will be
downloaded in the background and become active the next time
PDFKeeper is launched.  The objective is to ensure the latest version
of PDFKeeper is installed without user interaction. </FONT>
