<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1><font face="Segoe UI, sans-serif">Database
Setup</font></h1>
<p><font face="Segoe UI, sans-serif">PDFKeeper requires a relational
database management system for document storage. It can be
implemented for use in single user or multi user environments. If
implementing for use in a multi user environment, it is recommended
that the database be installed on a dedicated system that is capable
of handling the expected load.</font></p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI, sans-serif">At this time, PDFKeeper has only
been designed for use with <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/" target="_blank">Oracle
Database</a>. Future releases may include support for additional
relational database management systems based on user request and the
feasibility of implementation. For a database to be considered,
please open an new issue on the <a href="https://github.com/rffrasca/PDFKeeper/issues" target="_blank">Issue
Tracker</a>.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Segoe UI, sans-serif">As an
alternative to the fully supported, paid editions of Oracle Database,
Oracle offers an easy to install, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/xe.html" target="_blank">Oracle
Database Express Edition (XE)</a> which is perfect for single user or
small work group environments that do not need a fully supported
edition or for those who just wish to try out PDFKeeper &ndash; all
completely free!</font></p>
