<P><FONT FACE="Segoe UI, sans-serif">PDFKeeper requires a relational
database management system for document storage. It can be
implemented for use in single user or multi user environments. If
implementing for use in a multi user environment, it is recommended
that the database be installed on a dedicated system that is capable
of handling the expected load.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Segoe UI, sans-serif">At this time, PDFKeeper has only
been designed for use with <A HREF="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/" TARGET="_blank">Oracle
Database</A>. Future releases may include support for additional
relational database management systems based on user request and the
feasibility of implementation. For a database to be considered,
please open an new issue on the <A HREF="https://github.com/rffrasca/PDFKeeper/issues" TARGET="_blank">Issue
Tracker</A>.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Segoe UI, sans-serif">As an
alternative to the fully supported, paid editions of Oracle Database,
Oracle offers an easy to install, <A HREF="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/xe.html" TARGET="_blank">Oracle
Database Express Edition (XE)</A> which is perfect for single user or
small work group environments that do not need a fully supported
edition or for those who just wish to try out PDFKeeper &ndash; all
completely free!</FONT></P>
